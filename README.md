Hacker News Font Size Controller
-------------------------------

I have used a couple of custom style sheets for [http://news.ycombinator.com](http://news.ycombinator.com) in the past, and eventually found
that the default look to be the best: minimal and good readbility. However, the font size on hacker news appears too small on my most recent computer. 
Instead of getting a new "theme", I though it'd be nice to only change this one thing, and ideally I should be able to adjust it on the go. So I hacked together this Chrom Extension. 

It allows the user to drag a controller and resize all fonts proportionally to their original size, and remembers the setting to localStorage. This is better than browser zoom, as size of content containers remain fixed, so no annoying horizontal scrolling is intruduced. Hopefully this can help some hn reader with the same problem as well.  

Drag hnfontsize.crx into Chrome to install, or get it at [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adjust-hackernews-font-si/aeddhhildjkggkgmnpodilmofhbalmop)
