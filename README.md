Hacker News Font Size Controller
-------------------------------

I have used a couple of custom style sheets for [http://news.ycombinator.com](http://news.ycombinator.com) in the past, and eventually found
that the default look to be the best: minimal and good readbility. However, the font size on hacker news appears too small on my most recent computer. 
Instead of getting a new "theme", I though it'd be nice to only change this one thing, and ideally I should be able to adjust it on the go. So I hacked together this Chrom Extension. 

It allows the user to drag a controller and resize all fonts proportionally to their original size, and remembers the setting to localStorage. Hopefully this can help some hn reader with the same problem as well.
